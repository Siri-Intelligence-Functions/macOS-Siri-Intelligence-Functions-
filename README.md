## Overview  
macOS uses an **on-device Siri Intelligence system** that provides predictive actions,  
context-aware automation, proactive suggestions, language modeling, input analysis  
and smart system behaviours.

These AI-driven modules operate quietly inside the system.

The full intelligence map is available in the guide above.
